# Project Description:  
## This application facilitates:  
  
• Vietnamese Handwriting Practice: An AI driven function, utilized OpenAI APIs (openai-4o) to handle OCR, Natural Language Processing, and Text Generation. Users can upload images of Vietnamese handwritten text. The application recognizes the text to identify and correct grammar or spelling mistakes.  
• Vietnamese Audio Practice: Another function used Open AI APIs (whisper-1) to Voice Recognition and Generation Tasks. Users can directly record or upload their Vietnamese speech. The system analyses 
the content and provides feedback on tonal accuracy and linguistic nuances.  
• Customized Lessons and Quizzes: The application offers practical lessons and AI generated exercises designed to help users learn Vietnamese interactively.
